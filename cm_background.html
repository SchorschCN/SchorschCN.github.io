            Connected mobility is now an obvious trend attracts more and more concern.
            Therefore, theoretical basis of connection among vehicles, quality of service and some other aspects should be investigated.
            However, results of those investigation should be experimented with the help of simulation in computers.
            This topic "Connected Mobility" focuses on simulation of connected mobility.
